The word "Tamkeen" is derived from the Arabic word "تمكين" which means "Empower". The aim of Tamkeen School is to provide people with no previous background in Machine Learning and Data Science with the essential skills to start their career in the field. I co-founded Tamkeen and tutored around 75 people from different backgrounds, different genders, different ages and in various cities in Saudi Arabia.

title: "Sentence-level Quality Estimation for English-German Machine Translation"
excerpt: "The aim of the project is to exploit Natural Language Processing techniques to find the most suitable way of evaluating machine translation quality. The focus was on English-German corpora, where we showed that the use of a hierarchy of BiLSTMs along with adaptive max-pooling layers resulted in the best performance compared to: <br>
    * The use of pre-trained sentence-level embedding <br>
    * Using GloVe word embedding along with traditional machine learning regressors<br>"
